My name is Matteo Bonora, I'm a Computer Science student at [UniTrento](https://www.unitn.it/).

Since 2019 I am part of [E-Agle Trento Racing Team](https://eagletrt.it/) of which I am head of Software from 2020. I mostly work on Battery Management with [Simone Ruffini](https://simoneruffini.github.io/).

While programming microcontrollers for E-Agle I discovered my interest for embedded devices and, more broadly, hardware.

In my spare time I like dumpster-diving for old stuff.
