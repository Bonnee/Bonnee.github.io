## Timelapse

![Webcam view](https://www.villaclara.it/images/webcam/webcam.php)
I have a webcam on my roof, pointed at [Lake Garda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda). I always wanted to have a timelapse of the footage, but didn't have a server at the time to constantly fetch images. During the years I tried different methods, like using PHP running on a webserver to fetch the images and construct a video. To no one's surprise, that approach didn't work that well.\
I remember also toying with bash scripts on a Raspberry Pi, but I lost interest at some point and never revisited the problem again.

Last week the idea of using CI/CD came to me out of the blue, so I created [this](https://github.com/Bonnee/timelapse) repo that, leveraging [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), fetches images from a public webcam and composes them with ffmpeg into a timelapse. Currently, The repo is composed of the _Fetch_ and _Timelapse_ workflows, which pull the images using curl, and create a timelapse using ffmpeg respectively.
While testing this repo, I realized the unreliability of GH Actions (they are free after all): The _Fetch_ workflow sometimes takes more than 5 minutes to complete
