## Timelapse

![Webcam view](https://www.villaclara.it/images/webcam/webcam.php)
I have a webcam on my roof, pointed at [Lake Garda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Garda). I always wanted to have a timelapse of the footage, but didn't have a server at the time to constantly fetch images. During the years I tried different methods, like using PHP running on a webserver to fetch the images and construct a video. To no one's surprise, that approach didn't work that well.\
I remember also toying with bash scripts on a Raspberry Pi, but I lost interest at some point and never revisited the problem again.

Last week the idea of using CI/CD came to me. So I created [this](https://github.com/Bonnee/timelapse) repo that, leveraging [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), fetches images from a public webcam and composes them with ffmpeg into a timelapse. Currently, The workflows I created are _Fetch_ and _Timelapse_, which respectively pulls the images using curl, and creates a timelapse using ffmpeg.
While testing this repo, I realized the unreliability of GH Actions (they are free after all): The _Fetch_ workflow sometimes takes well over 5 minutes to complete, or doesn't get triggered at all. This affects the timelapse because frames are not equally spaced in terms of time, but it's still acceptable for my application. Another limitation for this use case is the schedule maximum frequency of 5 minutes, which is fine for me.

Overall I'm satisfied with the result. And unless my inbox gets full of failed action emails I will keep this automation going this way.
